          I am Kim Dianne G. Bagasona, a passionate software engineer

          I graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science from the
          Technological University of the Philippines in 2023. My education
          provided me with a solid foundation in software engineering principles
          and practices, equipping me to navigate the dynamic challenges of the
          tech industry.

          Beyond software development, I also have a strong background in
          graphic design, gained from my experience at Azaza Biz Solutions while
          attending school. This dual expertise allows me to seamlessly merge
          aesthetics with functionality, creating visually appealing and
          user-friendly software solutions that stand out.
